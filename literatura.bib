	title = {Field Monitoring and Numerical Modeling of Gas Flow and Radon Emission Control in Waste Rock Dump 38neu, Germany},
	abstract = {Since 1991, Wismut {GmbH} has been remediating uranium mining legacies in Eastern Germany. At the former Schlema-Alberoda mining site, waste rock dump 38neu was built along a natural slope on the edge of an inhabited valley. The dump has a 750 m width, a maximum thickness of 30 m and a total height of 100 m. Dump remediation involved surface resloping with benches and a 1 m thick soil cover. The dump characterization was focussed onthe soil cover:its air permeability, radon concentrations under the cover, and, across the soil cover, radon fluxes and differential pressures. In summer, relatively high radon concentrations and fluxes occur across the cover in the lower slope of the dump. Differential pressures indicate that gas flow is upward in the dump below the 9.5 ºC mean atmospheric temperature and downward otherwise. A numerical model using {TOUGH} {AMD} was validated against field measurements. Results indicate that gas flow is controlled by dump gas buoyancy relative to atmospheric air.Preferential gas entry and exit occur acrossthe dump lower slope where differential pressuresare highest, explaining the higher radon fluxes observed near the base of the dumpunder high atmospheric temperatures.},

	abstract = {At the former Schlema-Alberoda mining site, located in the south-east of Germany, waste rock dump 38neu was built along a natural slope on the edge of a valley. The dump is 750 m wide, with a maximum thickness of 30 m and a total height of 100 m. Dump remediation involved surface re-sloping and placement of a 1 m thick low-permeability soil cover. A characterisation aimed to verify the soil cover efficiency: its air permeability, radon concentrations under the cover and radon fluxes, as well as differential air pressures across the soil cover. In summer, relatively high radon concentrations and fluxes were found to occur across the cover in the lower slope of the dump. Differential pressures indicate that gas flow is upwards in the dump below the 9·5°C mean atmospheric temperature and downwards otherwise. A numerical model was developed to explain the relation between dump airflow and atmospheric conditions. The results indicate that airflow is controlled by dump gas buoyancy relative to atmospheric air. Preferential gas entry and exit occur across the dump’s lower slope, where differential pressures are highest, explaining the higher radon fluxes observed near the base of the dump under high atmospheric temperatures.},

	abstract = {The release of radon gas and radon progeny from uranium projects is a major issue during operation as well as for the design of rehabilitation works. In Australia, there have been a number of pre-mining radon flux studies as part of the environmental investigation and potential development of recent uranium projects. There is also an increasing amount of operational data on radon fluxes and loads from various aspects of projects, such as tailings, waste rock and mills. Thus there exists much useful measured data which can be used to assess the design radon flux and load targets for rehabilitation. The main projects for which radon data exists includes Ranger, Olympic Dam, Beverley, Honeymoon, Jabiluka, Yeelirrie, Lake Way, Koongarra, Moline, Coronation Hill, Rockhole, Nabarlek, Rum Jungle, Port Pirie and Ben Lomond. To date, much of this data has not been thoroughly evaluated. The need to compile and assess this data is twofold. Firstly, to assess the loads released from uranium production as an input into life-cycle analyses of the nuclear fuel cycle, such as those undertaken by {UNSCEAR} and industry groups. Secondly, there is a need to set suitable design standards for radon flux for the rehabilitation of former and current uranium projects. This paper will present such a detailed compilation of radon fluxes and loads which can then be used as the basis for both life-cycle analyses as well as setting appropriate site-specific rehabilitation criteria for radon. The implications for former and current projects is then discussed as well as future data needs.},

            Radon is a leading cause of lung cancer in indoor public and mining workers. Inhaled radon progeny releases alpha particles, which can damage cells in the airway epithelium. The extent and complexity of cellular damage vary depending on the alpha particle’s kinetic energy and cell characteristics. We developed a framework to quantitate the cellular damage on the nanometer and micrometer scales at different intensities of exposure to radon progenies Po-218 and Po-214. Energy depositions along the tracks of alpha particles that were slowing down were simulated on a nanometer scale using the Monte Carlo code Geant4-{DNA}. The nano-scaled track histories in a 5 μm radius and 1 μm-thick cylindrical volume were integrated into the tracking scheme of alpha trajectories in a micron-scale bronchial epithelium segment in the user-written {SNU}-{CDS} program. Damage distribution in cellular {DNA} was estimated for six cell types in the epithelium. Deep-sited cell nuclei in the epithelium would have less chance of being hit, but {DNA} damage from a single hit would be more serious, because low-energy alpha particles of high {LET} would hit the nuclei. The greater damage in deep-sited nuclei was due to the 7.69 {MeV} alpha particles emitted from Po-214. From daily work under 1 {WL} of radon concentration, basal cells would respond with the highest portion of complex {DSBs} among the suspected progenitor cells in the most exposed regions of the lung epithelium.},

The outflow of oxygen-deficient gas through a leachate drainage pipe in an enclosure at the base of the dump resulted in four fatalities in May 2006. A numerical model was developed to understand controls on gas flow, which was found to be related to the relative buoyancy of the dump gas phase compared to atmospheric air. Changes in atmospheric air density are caused by atmospheric temperature variations, whereas the dump gas phase density is fixed by the steady internal dump temperature. When atmospheric temperature is lower than the internal dump temperature, atmospheric air density is higher than dump gas density, inducing upward dump gas flow and air entry in the pipe. Instead, downward dump gas flow occurs and exits the pipe when high atmospheric temperature leads to an air density lower than dump gas density. A similar gas flow behavior would still occur without the pipe or without the till cover, indicating that the observed gas flow conditions could be present in other waste rock dumps. Additional},
